Recently, Max (@beakfriends) and I entered a Game Jam. Though we had a lot of fun, it wasn't quite the resounding success we'd hoped for. You can read up on that [here][heirtomb-postmortem].

However, we loved the idea so much that we decided to just keep going! And by keep going, I mean start again almost from scratch.

I'm going to be keeping a log of our progress! Go [here][latest-updates] if you want the latest updates, or go [here][first-dev-log] if you want to start from the very beginning!

Watch this space... As we get more and more done, you can bet that I'll be updating this page with little sneak previews, and who knows what else!
